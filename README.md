# Indie fighting game ads and assets for streamers and promotion

This repository hosts a collection of ads and stream cards for indie fighting games. The stream cards are in a 16:9 format and usually include social media info together with brief descriptions of the games.

## License and usage

These assets are free to use for content creators who want to show the games on stream, make a video about them, review them, or promote them. These assets are free to use for tournament organizers that want to support the indie fighting game scene. There are some caveats and additional conditions:
- These assets **cannot be used** in any events or content promoting, sponsored by or focused on web3/NFT/crypto content, in any shape or form.
- These assets **cannot be used** in any events or content promoting racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, and/or hate speech, in any shape or form.

Additional conditions can be negotiated/discussed with the individual developers. Each individual developer retains full rights over their game and can choose whichever condition apply to their promotional material.

## I am a streamer/tournament organizer, how do I download the assets?

Just head to [Releases](https://github.com/AndreaJens/indie-fighting-game-ads/releases/) and download the latest archive. GitHub calls it "source code", but - despite the name - you'll find all assets and stream cards inside the zipped file.

## How to add a missing game to this repository?

Open a GitHub issue and send me a link to your game, plus the stream card. Best size is **at least** 1280x720, PNG format. JPG is okay too. Make sure it's a 16:9 ratio. Other ratios are okay, but can make it harder for content creators to use them. I'm splitting fan-games from original IPs, so be sure to check the correct folder before sending a request.

If you don't have a GitHub account, contact me on Twitter ([@AndreaDProjects](https://twitter.com/AndreaDProjects)) or Discord (AndreaJens#9060).
By submitting a game to this repository, you agree to the conditions in the *License and usage* section.
